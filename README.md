## FOI'ing the BC Government E-Mail Logs

On July 9, 2013, I made the following FOI request:

> Message tracking log files (files beginning with MSGTRK in 
> %ExchangeInstallPath%TransportRoles\Logs\MessageTracking) from 
> e7hub01.idir.bcgov, e7hub02.idir.bcgov, e7hub03.idir.bcgov, 
> e7hub04.idir.bcgov, e7hub05.idir.bcgov, e7hub06.idir.bcgov, 
> e7hub07.idir.bcgov, e7hub08.idir.bcgov, e7hub09.idir.bcgov.  
> Date range is January 1, 2013 to July 3, 2013.

It's a novel request, in that it is asking for a new kind of record: automatically generated data created as a side-effect of ordinary government business. An e-mail log file is generated by a "mail exchange server" that delivers email from system to system. Every mail delivered goes through a mail server, and thus generates a record in the log file. The log file does not contain email contents, only *metadata* such as:

* the sender email address
* the recipient email address
* the date and time the email transitted the server
* the unique message number for the email
* the subject line of the email (Microsoft Exchange only)

At the time of my request a couple news items were making waves. 

* Edward Snowden had revealed that the US government was gathering [massive amounts of metadata](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/nsa-americans-metadata-year-documents) about public citizens; we would later learn that the Canadian government also engages in this kind of surveilance (it [still does](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/711481/freedom-of-information-request-on-canadas-top.pdf)). I wondered if government had the same open attitude about its own metadata as it appeared to have for the general public's metadata.
* Elizabeth Denham had [reported](https://www.oipc.bc.ca/investigation-reports/1559) out on the FOI implications of the "[ethnic outreach scandal](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/leaked-documents-reveal-liberals-plan-to-win-ethnic-vote-1.1325543)" and included some interesting notes about the use and abuse of government e-mail. 
* A [scandal in Ontario](http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/tech-expert-allegedly-linked-to-deleted-emails-had-contract-with-liberals-1.1753735) revolving around the deliberate deletion of e-mail records made me wonder about the persistance of log files as a kind of guarantee of data integrity.

So I made this request. I didn't expect it to take over two years and require the reading and writing of multiple legal briefs, but it did, so it was a learning experience at least.

### Section 43 Hearing (2014)

The government first stated (roughly) that because the logs contained personal information and they would have to review them all line by line my request was a nuisance on its face and they should be able to disregard it, under [Section 43](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/LOC/complete/statreg/--%20F%20--/Freedom%20of%20Information%20and%20Protection%20of%20Privacy%20Act%20[RSBC%201996]%20c.%20165/00_Act/96165_04.xml#section43) of the BC FOI Act.

* [OIPC Order (May 15, 2014)](http://s3.cleverelephant.ca/oipc/2014_s43_hearing/OrderF14-13.pdf)

The adjudicator did not evaluate the arguments in detail, he merely stated that Section 43 didn't apply since I was asking for the records in good faith and not trying to harass or impair the government with my request. And so we moved on to the next stage.

### Section 22 Hearing (2015)

The government next argued that because the request included personal information, and because it would be too much work to review all the data and remove the information, that they were unable to sever the information, so the release should be denied, under [Section 22](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/LOC/complete/statreg/--%20F%20--/Freedom%20of%20Information%20and%20Protection%20of%20Privacy%20Act%20[RSBC%201996]%20c.%20165/00_Act/96165_02.xml#section22) of the BC FOI Act.
